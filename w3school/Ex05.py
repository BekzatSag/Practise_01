#Programmers use comments to explain codes or to prevent Python from executing code:

#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

#You can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code
